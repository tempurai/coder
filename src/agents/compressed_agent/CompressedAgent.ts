const COMPRESSION_DECISION_PROMPT = `You are analyzing conversation context to determine if compression is needed.

Your task is to evaluate whether the current conversation history should be compressed based on:
- **Information Density**: Are there repetitive tool calls, verbose outputs, or redundant information?
- **Task Progression**: Is the conversation moving toward completion or still actively developing?
- **Context Value**: Would compressing now lose important working context vs preserving completed information?
- **Conversation Flow**: Is this a natural break point where compression would be beneficial?

# Decision Guidelines
**Recommend compression when:**
- Conversation contains completed tasks with lots of intermediate steps/outputs
- Many repetitive tool calls with similar results
- Clear task boundaries where previous context can be summarized
- Information that can be condensed without losing essential details

**Avoid compression when:**
- Currently in the middle of complex, ongoing work
- Recent context contains unresolved errors or partial solutions
- Working state that might be needed for next steps
- User seems to be building on recent specific details

Respond with JSON:
{
  "should_compress": true/false,
  "reasoning": "Clear explanation of your decision",
  "confidence": "high/medium/low"
}`;

const COMPRESSION_PROMPT = `You are a specialized context compression agent. Your task is to merge existing compressed context with new conversation history into a single, updated compressed summary that preserves maximum utility for future development tasks.

You will receive:
1. An existing compressed context (may be empty for first compression)
2. New conversation history that needs to be integrated

Your goal is to create a comprehensive yet concise summary that maintains ALL critical information needed for continued software engineering work.

# Critical Information to Preserve
- **Development Context**: Current project structure, key files, technologies used
- **Task State**: What the user is trying to achieve, current progress, blockers
- **Technical Details**: Important configurations, dependencies, patterns discovered
- **Decision History**: Why certain approaches were chosen, what was tried and failed
- **File Changes**: Specific files modified, created, or analyzed with their purposes
- **Tool Usage Patterns**: Successful workflows, problematic areas, optimization opportunities

# Compression Strategy
- **Merge, Don't Replace**: Integrate new information with existing context
- **Prioritize Actionable Information**: Keep details that directly impact future decisions
- **Preserve Context Chains**: Maintain logical connections between related information
- **Update Status**: Reflect current state accurately based on latest information
- **Remove Redundancy**: Eliminate duplicate information but keep unique perspectives

Create an updated compressed context by analyzing all the information and responding with a JSON object containing these fields:
- overall_goals: Updated list of main objectives the user is trying to achieve
- key_knowledge: Important facts, file paths, commands, configurations, project insights
- file_changes: Files that were read, modified, created, or are important
- task_progress: What has been completed, what's in progress, next steps
- recent_outcomes: Results of recent actions, errors, discoveries, current state
- context_quality: Your assessment of information preservation (high/medium/low)

Rules:
- Merge information from existing context with new history intelligently
- Update progress and outcomes based on new information while preserving historical context
- Keep essential details but remove verbose logs and repetitive content
- Maintain technical precision - preserve exact file paths, command syntax, error messages
- Be comprehensive yet concise - aim for maximum information density
- Output ONLY valid JSON, no other text
